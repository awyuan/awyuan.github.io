Hello world! I am a PhD Student at CICS UMass Amherst interested in explainable and 
trustworthy ML systems with special interest in LLMs and deep neural nets. I am advised by
[Dr. Przemyslaw Grabowicz](https://przemyslslaw.github.io), and am a member of the SIMS Lab.

Previously, I received my Bachelors of Science from Northeastern University, where I majored 
in Computer Science with a concentration in AI and a minor in Mathematics.

I believe that machine learning systems perform better when we can understand them, especially
as humans become increasingly in the loop in ML usage. Our newest AI systems need to be explainable
and align with our values and goals. My research explores how we can create these trustworthy
and intuitive systems. If you are interested, or just want to talk, feel free to 
[reach out](mailto:awyuan@umass.edu). 

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
